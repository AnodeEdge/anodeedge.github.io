Hi, I'm Scott Curtis, a licensed professional electrical engineer and site reliability engineer.

###### What I Do:

I learn the tools and skills to help developers and operations quickly and effectively deliver and maintain products by providing a means to offer seamless integration, deployment, and delivery with a focus on cost, availability, reliability, scalability, and maintainability. Ultimately, my goal is to optimize and automate myself out of a job.

###### Why I Do It:

I am stimulated by tackling unique problems and being a generalist who gets to work on a vast range of technical problems. Due to the explosive growth of cloud services and devops, there is a never-ending wealth of resources to tap into for any given project. The practice and philosophy of devops strongly correlates with my goal of providing QoL improvements to problem solvers, and reliable products to consumers.

###### Interests:

• CI/CD  
• Programming/Development  
• Cloud Services  
• Computer Architecture  
• 3D Printing  
• Electronics  
• DIY Projects
