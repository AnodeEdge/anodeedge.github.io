A skilled and creative problem solver, I understand how to take both a wide and a narrow look at situations in order to figure out how to navigate them efficiently. I am passionate about technology, finding inspiration in each new project that I take on, and it was the challenge that initially drew me to electrical engineering, the field where I started my career. Seeing the breadth of opportunities available in the software development field, I have since worked towards pivoting to DevOps and Site Reliability, and I am eager to participate in unique and cutting-edge projects.
{: style="text-align: justify" } 
Currently, I work as an electrical engineer with more than eight years, accruing a wealth of experience applicable not only to electrical engineering but to technology and analysis in general. Working in a highly collaborative field, I have developed a sense of how teams work effectively. I have also extensively researched and studied the technology topics that I have found most interesting, including high availability architecture, CI/CD pipelines, and 3D printing. I have spent significant time working with each of these interests on my own: overseeing 3D prints, deploying apps, and earning an AWS Solutions Architect Associate Certification. Although I have earned my income as an electrical engineer over the past decade, technology has remained my primary motivation.
{: style="text-align: justify" } 
Throughout my career, I have overseen projects in multiple environments and industries, including fossil, hydro, nuclear power plants, substations, and wastewater treatment plants. I am deeply flexible, taking to new projects quickly and approaching problems analytically. Although DevOps is a shift for me, it is a shift for which I have spent years preparing, the mindsets and the strategies that I have honed, readily applicable to the technology projects that I hope to take on.

He is passionate about technology, finding inspiration in each new project that he takes on, and it was the challenge that initially drew him to electrical engineering, the field where he started his career.

Previously, Scott worked as an electrical engineer for more than eight years, accruing a wealth of experience applicable not only to electrical engineering but to technology and analysis in general. Working in close proximity to the technology field, he has developed a sense of how DevOps teams work effectively. He has also extensively researched and studied the technology topics that interest him most, including high availability architecture, virtual reality, and 3D printing. He has spent significant time working with each of these technologies on his own: overseeing 3D prints, testing out VR systems, and earning his AWS Solutions Architect Associate Certification. Although he has earned his income as an electrical engineer over the past decade, technology has remained his primary motivation.

Scott discovered he had a passion for technology and computers at a very young age. Together with his father, a systems engineer, they would ping each other over LAN network and talk to each other in the same house this way.  -->

<!-- Add note about how engineering is an art -->


<!-- This is too specificically personal. Aim towards purposeful examples -->
<!-- Scott discovered his passion for technology and computers when he was a young boy. His father is an engineer as well, and he taught Scott to follow his natural interests. All throughout his adolescence, Scott was never short on educational toys, lab equipment, and science books, which his family provided to him, encouraging him to continue learning and practicing his skills as a researcher and problem solver. As supportive as they were, of course, there was some friction over the long hours he would spend on the one computer in the house, making it hard for anyone else to get computer time of their own. Always someone who goes looking for ways forward, Scott built a computer system of his own, sourcing the parts himself.

Programming, web development, robotics, math: these were Scott's obsessions during middle school and high school. Data interpretation and critical thinking came naturally to him, and that and his extreme curiosity led him to immerse himself in his STEM education even further.

In his career, Scott has overseen projects in multiple environments, including fossil, hydro, nuclear power plants, substations, and wastewater treatment plants. He is deeply flexible, taking to new projects quickly and approaching problems analytically. Although DevOps is a shift for him, it is a shift for which he has spent years preparing, the mindsets and the strategies that he has honed readily applicable to the technology projects that he hopes to take on.

A graduate of Stevens Institute of Technology, Scott earned his Bachelor's Degree in Electrical Engineering. In his free time, he enjoys playing the piano. -->
