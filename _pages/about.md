Hi, I'm Scott Curtis, software engineer and a licensed professional electrical engineer.  Currently working as an electrical engineer with aspirations to branch out into more software focused roles.

### How I Am:

**I love learning.** Discovering new things to dabble in and expand my available tools and knowledge base is one of my favorite pastimes.  This also translates into me having such a wide range of interests from 3D printing to playing the Ocarina.

**Solving problems is my jam.** Engineering is my bread.  I became an engineer knowing that I have a proclivity for technical problems and an aptitude for systematic problem solving.  I've always had a passion for science and technology. 

**I want to do things right.**  Whether it is by having clean code, developing a complete design, or architecting a scalable and reliable architecture, I always want to create something that I will be proud of and that will ultimately be easy and reliable to use.  Meeting commitments and fulfilling promises is very important to me.

### Why I Do It:

I am stimulated by tackling unique problems and being a generalist who gets to work on a vast range of technical problems. Due to the explosive growth of technology, there is a never-ending wealth of problems to solve. 

### Some Interests:

• CI/CD  
• Programming/Development  
• Cloud Services  
• Computer Architecture  
• 3D Printing  
• Electronics  
• DIY Projects
• Music
